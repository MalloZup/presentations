## 02 Learning the MVC model.

### A) Understanding the V (view) and the C (controller) and the M (model)

A view's purpose is to display information in a human readable format. 

You can understand the view as a webpage (html + javascript) plus  some erb eRuby (Embedded Ruby).

View are in

```bash
/app/views
```
### A1) Understanding erb (Embedded RuBy), the controller and view data flow

ERB is a template for passing varibles/data between controller (C) and the view (V).

- let's create a new view and controller with:

`rails generate controller Dog talk stop`

This will generate a new controller Dog and 2 views associated. Great!


We want now to maniulate the dog talk view.

Edit this file
* `vim  app/views/dog/talk.html.erb`

with this data
```
Hello, i am dog <%= @dogname %>.
Today is <%= Time.now.strftime('%A') %>.

There a lot of dogs out there.
<ul>
  <% @dogs_breed.each do |breed| %>
    <li><%= breed %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

```

now run as always the server with:

`rails server -p 9999`
and go to web-page : http://localhost:9000/dog/talk

Yop, an error it's normal. We can now have a look at the controller

* [NOTE] With the `<%= %>` you can pass variable to html !

### A2) Understanding the controller 

Controller manipulate data mostly from database (or not).

Let's have a look on our dog controller.

`vim app/controllers/dog_controller.rb`

we have 2 functions. We want to modify talk controller.

```ruby
class DogController < ApplicationController
  def talk
     @dogname = 'Pavarotti'
      # we want a list of dogs breed
     @dogs_breed = ['Australian Shepherd', 'Maltese', 'Weimaraner']
  end

  def stop
  end
end
```

`rails server -p 9999`


### A3) Understanding the Model.



### B) More advanced steps ( not mandatory).
