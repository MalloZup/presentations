## 02 Learning the MVC model.


### A) Understanding the V (view) and the C (controller).

A view's purpose is to display this information in a human readable format. 
A view just display informations.

A view is simply an start.html.erb, which is html plus erb eRuby (Embedded Ruby).

our view are in 

```bash
/app/views
```

A1) Understanding erb (Embedded RuBy), the controller and view data flow

ERB is a template for passing varibles/data between controller (C) and the view (V).

- let's create a new view and controller with:

`rails generate controller Dog talk stop`

This will generate a new controller Second and 2 views associated. Great!


We want now to maniulate the dog  talk view.

in this file
* `vim  app/views/dog/talk.html.erb`

insert this data
```
Hello, i am dog <%= @name %>.
Today is <%= Time.now.strftime('%A') %>.
```

With the `<%= %>` you can pass variable to html !


now run as always the server with:

```rails server -p 9999`
and go to web-page : http://localhost:9000/dog/talk
