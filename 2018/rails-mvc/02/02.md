## 02 Learning the MVC model.

### A) Understanding the V (view) and the C (controller) and the M (model)

A view's purpose is to display information in a human readable format. 

You can understand the view as a webpage (html + javascript) plus  some erb eRuby (Embedded Ruby).

View are in

```bash
/app/views
```
### A1) Understanding erb (Embedded RuBy), the controller and view data flow

ERB is a template for passing varibles/data between controller (C) and the view (V).

- let's create a new view and controller with:

`rails generate controller Dog talk dogpark`

This will generate a new controller Dog and 2 views associated. Great!


We want now to maniulate the dog talk view.

Edit this file
* `vim  app/views/dog/talk.html.erb`

with this data
```
Hello, i am dog <%= @dogname %>.
Today is <%= Time.now.strftime('%A') %>.

There a lot of dogs out there.
<ul>
  <% @dogs_breed.each do |breed| %>
    <li><%= breed %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

```

now run as always the server with:

`rails server -p 9999`
and go to web-page : http://localhost:9999/dog/talk

Yop, an error it's normal. We can now have a look at the controller

* [NOTE] With the `<%= %>` you can pass variable and ruby code to html !

### A2) Understanding the controller 

Controller manipulate data mostly from database (or not).

Let's have a look on our dog controller.

`vim app/controllers/dog_controller.rb`

we have 2 functions. We want to modify talk controller.

```ruby
class DogController < ApplicationController
  def talk
     @dogname = 'Pavarotti'
      # we want a list of dogs breed
     @dogs_breed = ['Australian Shepherd', 'Maltese', 'Weimaraner']
  end

  def dogpark
  end
end
```

`rails server -p 9999`

### A3) Understanding the Model.

The model is the part where we interact with the database with CRUD operations.
CRUD is an acronym for the four verbs we use to operate on data: Create, Read, Update and Delete.

Let's create a model.

``` rails generate model Dogparks city:string max_dogs_accepted:integer ```

Let's open the file in `db/migrate` directory.


```ruby
class CreateDogparks < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :dogparks do |t|
      t.string :city
      t.integer :max_dogs_accepted

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Migrations are designed to make it simple to create and modify database tables. ( you have same design in other framework and MVC sql webapp also in java susemanager)

#### Database exploration for fun and profit.

We want to have a look on our database before we run migration. In this way we will learn what is a migration.
Let's connect to the database

```bash
rails db
sqlite> .tables
sqlite> .quit
```

Now we will run the migration.

```ruby
rake db:migrate
```

And back again into database ( and look at the results!)

```bash
sqlite> .tables
ar_internal_metadata  dogparks              schema_migrations   
sqlite> .schema dogparks
CREATE TABLE "dogparks" ("id" integer PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL, "city" varchar, "max_dogs_accepted" integer, "created_at" datetime NOT NULL, "updated_at" datetime NOT NULL);
sqlite> .exit
```

#### Database population

Edit this file

`vim db/seeds.rb`

```ruby
Dogpark.find_or_create_by(city: 'Prague', max_dogs_accepted: '20')
Dogpark.find_or_create_by(city: 'Miami', max_dogs_accepted: '4')
Dogpark.find_or_create_by(city: 'Madrid', max_dogs_accepted: '2')
Dogpark.find_or_create_by(city: 'New York', max_dogs_accepted: '1')
Dogpark.find_or_create_by(city: 'Oslo', max_dogs_accepted: '20200')
```
We insert the data in database with:
```bash
rake db:seed or just run ruby db/seed.rb
```

Now let's check in database.

``` bash
rails db
SQLite version 3.11.0 2016-02-15 17:29:24
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> select * from dogparks;
1|Prague|20|2018-06-15 11:11:38.468618|2018-06-15 11:11:38.468618
...
```

#### Visualize our dogpark Data in our web-application.

We have a database with data.
We want to visualize it. As you remember, the view just visualize data. 
We need to edit first our controller and then adapt the view to visualize our data.

Let's have a look on the  fresh untouched controller dogpark.

Start the rails server and visit page http://localhost:9999/dog/dogpark 

It is empty.

let's edit the controller ```vim app/controllers/dog_controller.rb ```


```ruby
  def dogpark
    @dogparks = Dogpark.all
    @more_then_10 = Dogpark.where("max_dogs_accepted > ?", 10)
  end
```

Finally we can update our view with:

```
<h2>The total dogparks are:</h2>
<% @dogparks.each do |park| %>
<p><%= park['city'] %></p>
<% end %>

<p>

<h2>The dogparks that accept more then 10 dogs are</h2>
<% @more_then_10.each do |park| %>
<p><%= park['city'] %></p>
<% end %>
```

### Active Record


Active Record insulates you from the need to use SQL in most cases.

```vim app/controllers/dog_controller.rb ```
```ruby
  @miami =  Dogpark.order(:city)
  puts @miami.inspect()
```



##### Advanced exercise (not mandatory):

feel free to add a new row called name ( which will be the name of the dogpark).

Update your data.

Feel free to experiment with active record.
